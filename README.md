# Gesture-Controlled-Wheelchair-with-fall-and-obstacle-detection
Prototype of wheelchair build to aid the elderly and disabled people with their daily lives to provide them assitance as well as independence to an extent.

The gesture module is build using Arduino UNO, but can be made using other Arduino such as lily pad since that can be attached to the glove of the user for comfortability.
It is recommended that to use breadboard to test the system before soldering, it may require lots of trail and error.
The motors of wheelchair take lots of power, so 9v BATTERY may last for approx 6 - 8 hours in this system. Thus, if the wheels doesn't move, try to change the batteries and check again.
The values of accelerometer may vary for each, run the sample accelerometer program in Arduino IDE, note the range for x-axis and y-axis for each direction and configure as such.

Obstacle module is pretty straight forward, attach all four pins of ultrasonic sensor to the Arduino UNO, and buzzer as the output and configure it in Arduino IDE.

Thank you
